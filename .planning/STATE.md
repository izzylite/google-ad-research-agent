# State: Google Ad Research Agent

**Last updated:** 2026-05-08

## Project Reference

**Core value:** From one campaign brief, deliver campaign-ready keyword research — clusters, competitor intel, and negatives — in a single Claude Code session.

**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Skill Scaffold and Brief Intake (Plans 01-01 through 01-04 complete; next: Plan 01-05 validation/sign-off).

## Current Position

| Status | Plan 01-04 complete — SKILL.md authored (162 lines), per-step gates, required-field loop, run_init.py wired |
| Progress | `[░░░░░░░░░░] 0/6 phases complete` |

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- find_dotenv(usecwd=True) not usecwd=False in lib/config.py — usecwd=False searches from calling stack frame (inside project tree during tests), defeating monkeypatch.chdir() isolation; usecwd=True correctly respects test CWD and production CWD.
- lib/http.py intentionally absent from Phase 1 — no HTTP calls in Phase 1; writing untested stub now risks API mismatch when Serper/Tavily are designed in Phase 2.
- Claude Code skill (not standalone app) — operator already lives in Claude Code; second runtime adds no value.
- Three signal sources, three roles: WebSearch (free baseline), Serper.dev (structured SERP — PAA / related / ads), Tavily (deep competitor LP content).
- No volume / CPC API in v1 — rank on `source_diversity` (primary) + `signal_count` (tiebreak) + LLM intent weight; explicit "not search volume" labelling.
- Categorical 4-class intent rubric (informational / commercial / transactional / navigational), `temperature=0`, anchor examples in every prompt — drift prevention.
- LLM-driven clustering in v1 — `sentence-transformers` rejected (~700MB torch deps make skill non-portable); `scikit-learn` TF-IDF/k-means kept as v2 fallback only.
- Conversational brief intake (not structured form) — skill loops on 5 mandatory fields (industry, product, location, language, audience).
- `tavily_extract` not `tavily_crawl`, hard cap 5 competitors × 5 URLs, `extract_depth='basic'` — Tavily cost-blowup mitigation.
- `report.json` ships in v1 alongside `report.md` — stable canonical schema enables future run-diff without breaking changes.
- Generic engine v1 (no vertical presets) — defer to v2 once real usage reveals which verticals matter.
- Run-folder isolation, no caching, no cross-run mutable state — reproducibility over efficiency in v1.
- CLAUDE.md capped at 56 lines — directive not exhaustive; each section is a pointer so future executors stay on-rails without re-debating conventions.
- run_init.py derives slug and timestamp from run_dir.name (not re-calling iso_timestamp()) — guarantees stdout reflects actual on-disk folder name including any collision suffix.
- SKILL.md must quote run_init.py path: `uv run "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/run_init.py"` — handles spaces in operator paths.
- SKILL.md Phase 1 ends with hard STOP at Step 5 — Phase 2 signal collection will replace Step 5 in future skill update; no Phase 2 stubs added in Phase 1.
- SKILL.md operator trigger phrases front-loaded in description field ('keyword research', 'Google Ads research', 'PPC keywords', 'ad group clusters') — ensures Claude Code auto-discovers skill on brief paste.
- Brief rendered to OS temp file via Write tool before piping to run_init.py — avoids multiline shell quoting issues in Bash tool.

### Open Questions / Todos

- Composite ranking weight tuning (source_diversity vs signal_count vs intent) — v1 hypothesis; calibrate after first 3-5 real runs.
- Tavily credit consumption per run — estimated $0.09-$0.30; measure from run 1, adjust caps if needed.
- Cluster count vs vertical — narrow verticals may yield fewer than the 5-10 general recommendation; do not force the range.
- Match-type recommendation conservatism — validate after first campaign launch.

### Blockers

None.

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-05-08 — Completed Plan 01-04 (SKILL.md). 1 file created: SKILL.md (162 lines). 5-step Phase 1 workflow, per-step gates, required-field loop, conditional optional fields, hardwired run_init.py handoff. SCFD-01, INTK-01, INTK-02, INTK-03 satisfied.

**Stopped at:** Completed 01-04-PLAN.md

**Next session:** Execute Plan 01-05 (Validation / Sign-off — manual smoke checks 1-D-01 through 1-D-04 from VALIDATION.md).
